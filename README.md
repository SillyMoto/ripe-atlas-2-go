# RIPE Atlas 2 Go
##### Android App for Ripe Atlas

This App is part of my Master Thesis called "Untersuchung zum Einsatz der RIPE Atlas Plattform fÃ¼r Messung von Internet Diensten".
The platform RIPE Atlas is building the largest Internet measurement network.
With your help, you can expand the network, if you become an user and host your own probe.
For further information check out the RIPE Atlas website:

[RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net/)

As user you can perform your own measurements and test your own targets.
This App allows you to monitor your profile with your Measurements, Credits and API Keys.
For the functionality the app uses the RIPE Atlas API.
The manual can be found here:
